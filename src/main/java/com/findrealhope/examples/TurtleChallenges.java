/**
 * Challenges!
 *
 * - Can you tell the turtle to draw a box? That would be a nice start to a house!
 *
 * - Can you tell your turtle to erase blocks instead of create them?
 *   Hint: there is a block type called "Blocks.air"
 *
 *
 *
 * Advanced math challenges
 * - The turtle is good at drawing lines that go east to west, north to south, or up to down.
 *   But how about a line that goes NE to SW? Or a line that goes exactly in the direction you are facing?
 *   Hint: search youtube for Bresenham
 *
 * - Can you tell the turtle how to draw a circle? Curves are hard in a blocky world.... A computer screen
 *   is also made up of blocks (pixels) so how do they manage to draw curves?
 *   Hint: search youtube for midpoint circle algorithm
 *
 * - Other tricky shapes: cylinder, prism (a prism would be handy for making roofs!), sphere
 *
 * - Tell the turtle to plot a function such as sin(x)*2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Artistic challenge
 * - We don't get to see the turtle sadly..... it's only an imaginary turtle... ;(
 *   So fix that! Write a mod that adds a new creature to the game: a cute little turtle.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Very hard expert level Java programming challenge
 * - Make a new type of turtle which draws slowly, one block per second, so you can actually see
 *   the blocks getting created in the game one at a time instead of all at once.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * More ideas
 * - Generate random mazes you can walk through.
 * - Draw words in the sky
 * - Draw a fractal
 * - Draw Langton's Ant
