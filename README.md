[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianfromoregon/ForgeProject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianfromoregon/ForgeProject)

#### Setup
1. Install [Oracle JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 
2. Install an IDE. 
 * I prefer [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) 
 * But [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) works too, pick "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
3. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Git clone this repo, the URL is _https://github.com/brianfromoregon/ForgeProject.git_
5. Follow IDE-specific instructions in [README.txt](README.txt)

#### Verify
1. Run Minecraft client from within IDE
2. Create a new world in Creative mode
3. Type the word *draw* in chat and see if a line of glass blocks is created in front of you
